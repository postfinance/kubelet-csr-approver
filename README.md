# kubelet-csr-approver

Kubelet CSR approver is a Kubernetes controller whose sole purpose is to
auto-approve [`kubelet-serving` Certificate Signing Request
(CSR)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/#kubelet-serving-certs),
provided these CSRs comply with a series of configurable, provider-specific,
checks/verifications.

Inspired by existing projects (such as
[`kubelet-rubber-stamp`](https://github.com/kontena/kubelet-rubber-stamp)), it
implements additional verifications to prevent an attacker from forging
Certificates.

## Quick start

1. deploy `kubelet-csr-approver` on your k8s cluster using the manifests
   present in [`deploy/k8s`](deploy/k8s)
2. change the `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` file and restart your kubelet once
   having included the following field: `yaml serverTLSBootstrap: true`
3. at that point, there should be a number of CSRs on your cluster, that the
   `kubelet-csr-approver` will approve (or deny) depending on the deployment
   parameters you have set.

### Parameters

The most important parameters (configurable through either flags or environment
variables) are:

* `--provider-regex` or `PROVIDER_REGEX` lets you decide which hostnames can be
approved or not\
e.g. if all your nodes follow a naming convention (say
`node-randomstr1234.int.company.ch`), your regex could look like
`^node-\w*\.int\.company\.ch$`
* `--max-expiration-sec` or `MAX_EXPIRATION_SEC` lets you specify the maximum
`expirationSeconds` the kubelet can ask for.\
Per default it is hardcoded to a maximum of 367 days, and can be reduced with
this parameter.
* `--bypass-dns-resolution` or `BYPASS_DNS_RESOLUTION` -> permits to bypass DNS resolution
check. \
the default value of the boolean is false, and you can enable it by
setting it to `true` (or any other option listed in GoLang's
[`ParseBool`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/strconv/atob.go#L10)
function)
* `--bypass-hostname-check` or `BYPASS_HOSTNAME_CHECK`: when set to true,
it permits having a DNS name that differs (i.e. isn't prefixed) by the hostname
* `--provider-ip-prefixes`  or `PROVIDER_IP_PREFIXES` permits to specify a
  comma-separated list of IP (v4 or/and v6) subnets/prefixes, that CSR IP
  addresses shall fall into. left unspecified, all IP addresses are allowed. \
  you can for example set it to `192.168.0.0/16,fc00::/7` if this reflects your
  local network IP ranges.
* `--ignore-non-system-node` or `IGNORE_NON_SYSTEM_NODE` permits ignoring CSRs
  with a _Username_ different than `system:node:......`. \
  the default value of the boolean is false, and if you want to use this feature
  you need to set this flag to `true`
* `--allowed-dns-names` or `ALLOWED_DNS_NAMES` permits allowing more than one
  DNS name in the certificate request. the default value is set to 1.
* `--leader-election` or `LEADER_ELECTION` permits enabling leader election
  when running with multiple replicas

It is important to understand that the node DNS name needs to be
resolvable for the `kubelet-csr-approver` to work properly. If this is an issue
for you, please file an issue and I'll add a flag to disable this validation.

â„¹ have a look below in this README to understand which other validation
mechanisms are put in place.

## Helm Install

Adjust `providerRegex`, `providerIpPrefixes` and `maxExpirationSeconds` as needed.

```bash
helm repo add kubelet-csr-approver https://postfinance.github.io/kubelet-csr-approver
helm install kubelet-csr-approver kubelet-csr-approver/kubelet-csr-approver -n kube-system \
  --set providerRegex='^node-\w*\.int\.company\.ch$' \
  --set providerIpPrefixes='192.168.8.0/22' \
  --set maxExpirationSeconds='86400'
  --set bypassDnsResolution='false'
```

## Attacker model -- what could go wrong ?

Shall our CSR auto-approver not be implemented correctly, it might permit an
attacker to get forged CSRs to be approved and later on signed by the K8s
certificate controller.

Indeed, while there are some verifications done by the final certificate signer
controller (for the details,
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.22.2/pkg/controller/certificates/signer/signer.go#L253-L258)
and
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.22.2/pkg/apis/certificates/helpers.go#L62-L88)),
nothing prevents a CSR impersonating a `DNSName` or an `IPAddress` from getting
signed.

Put more concretely, if a CSR requesting the DNS name `auth.company.com` or
`control-plane.k8s.local` (or both!) was to be approved, it would get signed
and the attacker would have a very valid certificate to make use of. (and
depending on the `ca.key` used on your cluster, this could have a measurable
impact)

## Which verifications do we put in place ?

Taking inspiration from [Kubernetes built-in CSR
approver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.22.2/pkg/controller/certificates/approver/sarapprove.go),
we check the following criteria:

* `CSR.Spec.SignerName` must be `"kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving"`
* `CSR.Spec.ExpirationSeconds`, if specified, must be smaller than `MAX_EXPIRATION_SEC`\
  (the default value and hard-coded maximum for this controller is 367 days)
* `CSR.Spec.Username` must be prefixed with `system:node:` (i.e. we only
  want to treat CSRs originating from the nodes themselves)
* x509 CR `CommonName` must be equal to the `CSR.Spec.Username`
* CSR DNS SubjectAlternativeNames (SAN) contains at most one entry
* at least one SAN IP address or SAN DNS Name must be specified
* CSR SAN DNS Name (if specified) must comply with a provider-specific
  regex.
* CSR SAN DNS Name (if specified) must be prefixed with the node hostname
  (where the hostname corresponds to `CSR.Spec.Username` trimmed of the
  `system:node:` prefix)
* CSR SAN IP Addresses must all be part of the set of IP addresses resolved
  from the SAN DNS Name
* the CSR SAN DNS Name (if specified) must resolve to IP address(es) that
  fall within the set of provider-specified IP ranges.
* the CSR SAN IP Address(es) must fall within a set of provider-specified IP
  ranges

With those verifications in place, it makes it quite hard for an attacker to
get a forged hostname to be signed, it would indeed require:

* to impersonate a user on the Kubernetes API server with a `Username` that
  prefixes the SAN DNS Name request. \ concretely, if the attacker wants to
  forge a CSR for the `auth.company.ch` domain, s/he would need to create a CSR
  with the username `system:node:a` (remember, we only check the that the DNS
  name is prefixed by the node name) \ it might then be possible to create a
  CSR from a node `a` (not a smart name for a node, I agree), or a node `auth`,
  already more plausible
* to modify the provider-specific regex of the `kubelet-csr-approver` (requires
  API access or direct access to the node where the controller is running). \
  however with API access, the attacker could as well also directly approve the
  CSR, and with full node access, the attacker could retrieve the controller's
  ServiceAccount and approve the CSR as well.

## Is this CSR approver safe ?

Provided that the provider-specific regex is strict, that the IP ranges set is
correctly specified, that the DNS system is not compromised, this automatic CSR
approver would make it quite hard for an attacker to start forging CSRs.

### Could this CSR approver be safer ?

For sure, this simply requires modifying the `ProviderChecks(csr , x509csr))`
function to implement additional checks (such as validating the node identity
in an external inventory)

# Build and development

When building locally to run the CSR approver on an actual cluster with e.g. the
`oidc` authentication provider, you need to use the tag `debug` to import all
authentication providers. You will then build as follows:

```bash
go build -tags debug ./cmd/kubelet-csr-approver/
```
